Create an up-voting app for a local music venue!

A local music venue has asked you to build a promotional app: Bring The Band! Bring the band will allow users to vote for musicians they want to see at the venue. The venue hopes to gain a following, and boost their patron engagement by tracking popular bands, and trends in their market share.

Explorer Mode

Using React components, create 2 pages, a Search page and a Votes page in addition to login/signup functionality
Your Search page should include a Search field and search button.
The search field should query Spotify if the user presses "enter" or clicks the search button.
The results of the Spotify search should be displayed as a list of bands.
For each band in the list, display an image, the band name, and a button allowing the user to vote for them.
If the user votes for a band, save that band to your backend (use kinvey).
Your Votes page should display all bands that have been voted for so far.
For each band in the list, display an image, the band name. For Explorer mode, don't worry about having duplicate bands in this list.
Write tests AT LEAST for any custom functions created on models or collections
